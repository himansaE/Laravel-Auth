# Project Architecture Rules

- This is a Laravel 11 project.
- Follow the standard MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.
- **Service Layer:** Place complex business logic in Service classes inside the `app/Services/` directory. Controllers should remain thin and focused on handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **Frontend:** Use Blade templates for all views. Do not use React, Vue, or other SPA frameworks.
- **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS for all styling.
- **Components:** Create reusable UI elements as Blade components in `resources/views/components/`.
